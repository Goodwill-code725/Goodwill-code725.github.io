         This project was originally started by a previous OJT but was left incomplete. 
         I was tasked to continue and enhance the system during my training at Adventist Medical Center Valencia (AMCV). 
         Working alongside the junior developer, we discussed and finalized the design and functionality of the web application. 
         The system was built using PHP (CodeIgniter) and styled with Bootstrap 3.

           The dashboard provides a quick overview of the inventory system. It displays the total number of products, alerts for low-stock items, and the total number of orders. 
           This helps users monitor inventory status and take action when needed.
